===User Guide===

Installation:
No additional dependencies have been added beyond the database and JavaFX. To run the project, either download as a .zip file, or use git to clone the repository.

Add the project to Eclipse. Before attempting to run the project, verify that your run configuration includes the correct VM arguments and your module/classpaths match ASUHelloWorldJavaFX.

Set your application entry point to StartCSE360.java. If your database contains any data from previous student submissions, please clear these as it may not be compatible with our system. Run the project.

Using:
Begin by creating an admin account. Applicable error messages will guide you through the process of making an acceptable username and password. You can then continue to the rest of the application.

To make a new user account, have an administrator generate an invite code and assign you a role as either "user" or "admin". You will then be prompted to enter your name, username, password, email, and this invite code.

Enjoy!
